# 3D project
 Its a 3D cube animation project using only css3 and HTML5.In this project I have used different images and set them at different angles.The cube is moved by using HTML input tag of radio type.As we all know that a cube has 6 sides or we can say 6 portions.So thats why we have 6 input type radio buttons in our HTML.When user clicks any of them the cube is moved to that direction.And by default and cubes moves dynamically.
